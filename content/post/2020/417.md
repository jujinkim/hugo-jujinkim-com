The battery is a very expensive stuff that provides electricity without a line on a portable electronic device. However, most batteries are for one time, and rechargeable charging stations are expensive for 5 times. Of course, it can be a long-term benefit, but because there is a lot of places where the battery is needed, it is not possible to fill all these places. So we bought the battery and put it on the device, and it works only when it is necessary to try to use the battery as long as possible.

However, it is possible to recharge battery. Recharging the primary battery used only once, it is not recommended that performance is low, and explosion risk due to impurities. The battery that can be recharged automatically by placing the battery that has this problem, and the battery that can be recovered has appeared again. It is a product called "Enerroid" created by the domestic venture company "Secure", and you can find out what you are looking for and what you are looking for.

It is a product that has been funded by Wdyss, and it is also a good environment where crowdfunding is scam, and Wdys is so much to say, "Wdysss that believe and do." First of all, this product is also the second version, and the first version is not good, and it is believed to be money. It seems to be late for a month than expected, and it’s time to be late for a second month, and it’s time to come up for a week.

I don't know the principle, but I don't charge the first battery and make it a little more bitter, Eneroid!

I'm not afraid of unboxing photos. I didn't know the video. There are no facts.

It looks like HAL9000 cleaned.



If you open the lid of an Android and put a multi-written one-time battery, then you can’t find out that the nome that cannot be charged is broken and the nome is locked after being charged. I don't know the principle, but I don't know where + where - whether After you are aware of the charge. It's so good.

If you do not know if you do not know if you do not know if you do not know if you do not have a closure + sympathetic complications. However, there is nothing to do with the battery charging, and the deadline is not known.

This product is a USB-B type. It is a USB-C type. C type is popular Aran B I would like to be disappeared in different history.

Open the lid and put the battery here, and enter it into the hole below and fill it in force. If I was a battery, it would be amazing.



The inside is no star than the thought. Of course, it is a structure that engineers and designers are crafted and created, but we don’t know that we are. It's only just that if you're charging the battery well.  
If you have enough space and motors, you can find the battery you want to charge. If you don't need to worry about the next battery, it is very good.

Aloft Seoul



There is also a battery that determines that it is no longer charged during the dog. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. This post is also available in: 영어, 일어, 중국어 간체   
The wall between the left and right is not only about 1 mm high, but it feels like a barrier that breaks the mimics. However, it may be charged if you attempt to recharge the previous map that I do not know. This product is not part of the world as a paradigm, and I wanted to claim that there is a chance to be a paradigm.

HAL9000



When the power is connected, the blue light comes, pressing the button will start charging with red light. Because the time of filling is pretty It's time to look at it. No sound in charge. I am surprised that I am surprised by the sound when I sometimes overflowed with a messy battery. I can't grow my cat and I'm too tricky, so I'm going to go up with me, I'm going to go alone and I'm going to see my popularity.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. We will not only know the performance and results, but we will not be able to see what it is first charged. In fact, the battery is not ordinary garbage, and it contains complex and dangerous chemicals in it, which is one of the most demanding things that are dumped. Well, I've been pretty tired of writing, and I've been rushed to a single time. Now, this product minimizes waste of one product, protects the environment, saves money to leave the battery, reducing the lightning of the battery, so we can expect our life and the world to be cleaned and improved. It’s not too much, but it’s good to develop battery&battery technology.
